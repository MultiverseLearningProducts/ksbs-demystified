# D21: practice continuous self learning to keep up to date with technological developments to enhance relevant skills and take responsibility for own professional development.

Being a software developer, particularly in today's rapidly evolving technological landscape, is more than just a job. It is a commitment to lifelong learning and continuous professional development. Here are some aspects in more detail:

1. **Continuous Self Learning**: Technology is always advancing, with new programming languages, tools, and frameworks being developed constantly. In addition, best practices evolve over time as we learn more about how to effectively develop software. Therefore, software developers need to continually learn new skills and technologies to keep up with these changes. This could involve reading books and online resources, taking courses, attending seminars or webinars, participating in coding bootcamps, etc.

2. **Keeping Up with Technological Developments**: Following on from the above, a key part of self-learning is staying informed about the latest technological developments. This means following industry news, subscribing to relevant blogs, podcasts, newsletters, attending industry conferences, and getting involved in online communities. This could involve learning about new programming languages, changes to existing languages, new software or tools, advancements in methodologies like Agile or DevOps, or updates on relevant legislation or standards.

3. **Enhancing Relevant Skills**: While it's important to stay informed about a wide range of technologies, it's also vital to focus on enhancing skills that are most relevant to your current role or career aspirations. For example, a developer who works primarily with web technologies would want to stay up-to-date with the latest developments in JavaScript frameworks, CSS preprocessors, etc. This means not only learning these new technologies but practicing them through personal projects or contributing to open source.

4. **Taking Responsibility for Own Professional Development**: A significant aspect of being a software developer is taking ownership of your professional growth. This means identifying areas where you need to improve, setting learning goals, and taking steps to achieve them. It also involves seeking feedback from peers, mentors, and supervisors, and using this feedback to guide your learning. Professional development can also be about broader skills, like project management, teamwork, communication, and understanding the business or industry you're developing software for.

5. **Certifications and Further Education**: Earning relevant certifications and pursuing further education can also be a part of professional development. There are many industry-recognized certifications for different aspects of software development, such as those offered by Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, and many more. Similarly, further education, like a Master's degree or PhD, can also be beneficial, especially for more research-oriented or high-level positions.

An apprentice software developer should view their career as a journey of continuous learning and growth. By staying informed about technological advancements, practicing self-learning, focusing on relevant skills, and taking ownership of their professional development, they can ensure they're always at the cutting edge of their field.

# D9: write logical and maintainable software solutions to meet the design and organisational coding standards (Software Development Lifecycle - Implementation and Build phase).

1. **Writing Logical Software Solutions:** This means that the apprentice software developer is expected to write code that is logically sound and coherent. It means ensuring that the software behaves correctly and consistently under a variety of circumstances, including different user inputs or system states. This includes writing algorithms that efficiently and accurately perform tasks, handling edge cases (unexpected or extreme input scenarios), and avoiding logical errors (bugs) that can lead to incorrect behavior.

2. **Writing Maintainable Software Solutions:** Code is rarely written once and never touched again. It evolves over time as features are added, bugs are fixed, and the needs of the organization change. Therefore, it is essential to write code that is easily understandable, well-documented, and structured in a way that future developers (including the developer themselves) can understand and modify. This includes using meaningful variable and function names, adding comments to explain complex code sections, and organizing code into coherent modules or classes.

3. **Meeting Design and Organisational Coding Standards:** Every organization has its own set of coding standards and best practices. These can include specific conventions for naming variables and functions, the use of specific coding constructs or design patterns, rules for code organization, and more. They may also follow specific design principles, such as SOLID principles in object-oriented programming. The apprentice developer needs to understand and follow these standards. Moreover, it's about translating the software design (which might come in forms such as UML diagrams or functional specifications) into actual code, ensuring it aligns with the architectural vision.

4. **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) - Implementation and Build Phase:** The SDLC is a framework that defines the process used by organizations to build an application from its inception to its end. The Implementation and Build phase is where developers start coding the software according to the previously decided plans and designs.

   - In the **Implementation phase**, the software design is translated into source code. Each component of the design is implemented as a code module, and these modules are integrated to form the complete system. It also involves unit testing where individual components are tested for their functionality.

   - The **Build phase** typically involves integrating the various modules of the software, compiling the source code into executable code, and then conducting integration testing to find and fix issues that occur when the different modules interact.

Remember, it's not just about writing code that works, it's about writing code that's easy to understand, maintain, and extend. That's a fundamental aspect of being a professional developer, and is a big part of the value you bring to an organization.

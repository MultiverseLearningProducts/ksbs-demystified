# D1: take and interpret given software development requirements to estimate effort to deliver the work product to enable accurate costs to be established.

There are several key responsibilities of an apprentice software developer:

1. **Take software development requirements**: When a new feature, application, or software system needs to be developed, the team typically starts with requirements. These are detailed descriptions of what the software should do, who will use it, how it will be used, and so on. These requirements can come from a variety of sources, such as a client, a project manager, a team of analysts, or even the developer's own understanding of the problem. An apprentice developer needs to understand these requirements fully in order to do their job effectively.

2. **Interpret the requirements**: Understanding the requirements isn't enough. The developer also needs to be able to interpret them, meaning they need to be able to translate the often high-level and business-oriented language of the requirements into a more technical language that they can use to guide their work. This could involve creating a technical specification, sketching out a potential architecture, identifying key algorithms or data structures that will be needed, and so on.

3. **Estimate the effort to deliver the work product**: Once the developer has a good understanding of what needs to be built, they have to estimate how long it will take to build it. This involves a good understanding of their own abilities, as well as the complexities of the requirements. They'll need to consider the difficulty of the tasks, the potential for unknowns and roadblocks, and their own proficiency and speed. This process of estimation is often iterative, with initial rough estimates refined over time as more information becomes available.

4. **Enable accurate costs to be established**: The estimates that the developer produces are crucial for project management, as they help to establish the overall cost of the project. Time, after all, is money. If a project is estimated to take a longer time, it will generally cost more (in terms of salary, overhead costs, opportunity cost, etc.). Conversely, if the project is estimated to take a shorter time, it will generally cost less. Accurate estimates therefore help project managers, clients, and other stakeholders make informed decisions about the feasibility and profitability of a project.

An apprentice software developer is not just writing code. They are also taking in and interpreting complex information, making informed predictions about the future, and aiding in important business decisions. This mix of technical and soft skills is crucial for success in the role.

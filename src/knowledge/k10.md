"Principles and uses of relational and non-relational databases" refers to
understanding the fundamental concepts, characteristics, and applications of
both relational databases and non-relational databases (also known as NoSQL
databases). As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating knowledge in this
area would involve having a solid understanding of the following aspects:

Relational Databases:

1. **Principles**: Understanding the principles of relational databases, such as
   the relational model, normalization, entities, attributes, relationships, and
   the concept of structured data organized into tables.
2. **SQL**: Knowledge of Structured Query Language (SQL) and its usage for
   creating, querying, and manipulating data in relational databases.
3. **ACID**: Awareness of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
   properties that ensure data integrity and reliability in transactions.
4. **Data Integrity**: Understanding and implementing constraints like primary
   keys, foreign keys, unique keys, and referential integrity to maintain data
   integrity.
5. **Normalization**: Familiarity with normalization techniques to optimize
   database structure and eliminate data redundancy.
6. **Joins**: Ability to perform various types of joins (e.g., inner join, outer
   join) to retrieve data from multiple related tables.

Non-Relational Databases:

1. **Types**: Knowledge of different types of non-relational databases, such as
   document databases (e.g., MongoDB), key-value stores (e.g., Redis), columnar
   databases (e.g., Cassandra), and graph databases (e.g., Neo4j).
2. **NoSQL Concepts**: Understanding the fundamental principles of NoSQL
   databases, including schema-less data models, eventual consistency,
   horizontal scalability, and distributed architectures.
3. **Data Modeling**: Proficiency in designing data models suited for
   non-relational databases, such as denormalization, embedding documents, or
   using key-value pairs.
4. **API Usage**: Familiarity with programming APIs and query languages specific
   to different NoSQL databases.
5. **Use Cases**: Awareness of when to choose non-relational databases over
   relational databases, based on the requirements of the application (e.g.,
   high scalability, flexible schema, handling large volumes of unstructured
   data).

Demonstrating knowledge in these areas would involve being able to explain these
concepts, utilize relevant database technologies, write queries, design
appropriate database schemas, and choose the right database type based on
specific use cases.

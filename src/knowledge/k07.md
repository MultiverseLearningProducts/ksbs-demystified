When an apprentice software developer is expected to demonstrate knowledge of
"software design approaches and patterns, to identify reusable solutions to
commonly occurring problems," it means they should be familiar with established
methodologies and techniques for designing software systems and be able to apply
them to solve common problems that arise in software development. Here's a
breakdown of the key concepts:

1. **Software Design Approaches**: These refer to different systematic ways of
   designing software systems. Common approaches include structured design,
   object-oriented design, and service-oriented architecture. Each approach has
   its own principles, practices, and patterns that guide the design process.

2. **Design Patterns**: Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly
   occurring problems in software design. They provide proven solutions that
   have been identified and refined over time. Examples of design patterns
   include the Singleton pattern, Factory pattern, Observer pattern, and MVC
   (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Each pattern addresses a specific problem
   and provides a template for designing a solution.

3. **Reusable Solutions**: The focus on reusable solutions implies that the
   apprentice should have an understanding of how to create modular and flexible
   software designs. Instead of reinventing the wheel for every problem, they
   should strive to identify patterns, frameworks, libraries, or components that
   can be reused across different projects to improve efficiency,
   maintainability, and scalability.

4. **Commonly Occurring Problems**: These are recurring challenges faced during
   software development. Examples include managing dependencies, handling
   concurrency, designing user interfaces, implementing data storage and
   retrieval, optimizing performance, and ensuring security. By being
   knowledgeable about software design approaches and patterns, the apprentice
   should be able to identify appropriate solutions for these types of problems.

Demonstrating knowledge of software design approaches and patterns means
understanding different design methodologies, being familiar with established
design patterns, and applying them to solve common problems encountered in
software development. It showcases the ability to create reusable and efficient
software solutions by leveraging proven design principles and patterns.

The software development life cycle (SDLC) refers to the process followed to
develop software applications. It consists of various stages or phases that help
ensure the successful planning, creation, deployment, and maintenance of
software systems. Here are the typical stages of the SDLC, along with their
inputs and outputs:

1. **Requirements Gathering**:

   - Inputs: User needs, business requirements, system constraints, and other
     relevant information.
   - Outputs: Software requirements specification document, which outlines the
     functional and non-functional requirements of the software.

2. **Analysis and Planning**:

   - Inputs: Requirements document, project scope, and available resources.
   - Outputs: System design document, project plan, and schedule. This stage
     involves analyzing the requirements, identifying potential risks, and
     planning the development process.

3. **Design**:

   - Inputs: System design document, functional requirements, and design
     guidelines.
   - Outputs: Detailed design documents, such as architecture diagrams, database
     schema, and user interface mockups. This stage focuses on creating a
     blueprint for the software, including its structure and components.

4. **Implementation or Coding**:

   - Inputs: Detailed design documents, programming languages, and development
     tools.
   - Outputs: Executable code or software modules that implement the specified
     functionality. This stage involves writing the actual code, following
     coding standards and best practices.

5. **Testing**:

   - Inputs: Software modules, test cases, and test data.
   - Outputs: Test results, defect reports, and documentation. This stage
     involves executing tests to identify and fix bugs, validate the software
     against the requirements, and ensure its quality and reliability.

6. **Deployment**:

   - Inputs: Tested and approved software, deployment environment, and user
     documentation.
   - Outputs: Installed software or released product, user manuals, and
     installation guides. This stage involves deploying the software to the
     production environment, making it available for end-users.

7. **Maintenance and Support**:
   - Inputs: Deployed software, user feedback, and change requests.
   - Outputs: Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements. This stage involves
     addressing issues reported by users, making necessary updates or
     enhancements, and providing ongoing support for the software.

It's important for an apprentice software developer to understand each stage of
the SDLC, the inputs required for each stage, and the expected outputs. This
knowledge helps ensure that the developer can contribute effectively to the
software development process and deliver high-quality software products.

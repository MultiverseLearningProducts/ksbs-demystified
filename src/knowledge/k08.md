"Organisational policies and procedures relating to the tasks being undertaken,
and when to follow them" refers to the set of rules, guidelines, and protocols
established by an organization that govern the actions and behavior of its
employees or members. These policies and procedures provide a framework for
conducting various tasks within the organization, including software
development.

As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating knowledge of organizational
policies and procedures involves understanding and adhering to the specific
guidelines set by your organization in relation to the tasks you are assigned.
These policies may cover a wide range of areas, including information security,
data protection, code management, software development methodologies, and more.

One specific example mentioned is the storage and treatment of GDPR (General
Data Protection Regulation) sensitive data. GDPR is a data protection law that
sets guidelines for the collection, storage, and processing of personal data
within the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). If your
organization handles personal data covered by GDPR, there will be specific
policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with these regulations.

As an apprentice software developer, you need to demonstrate knowledge of these
policies and procedures by understanding the requirements for handling GDPR
sensitive data. This may include knowing how to securely store and transmit such
data, implementing appropriate data protection measures, obtaining necessary
consents, and ensuring compliance with other GDPR obligations.

By demonstrating your knowledge of organizational policies and procedures,
including GDPR compliance, you show that you understand the importance of
following established rules and guidelines to protect sensitive data, maintain
security, and uphold legal and regulatory obligations.

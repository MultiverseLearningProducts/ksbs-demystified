# K2: roles and responsibilities within the software development lifecycle (who is responsible for what)

- [ ] Assessment method 1: Work-based project with questioning

"Roles and responsibilities within the software development lifecycle" refers to the different individuals or teams involved in the various stages of developing software and the tasks or responsibilities assigned to them. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) encompasses the entire process of creating, testing, deploying, and maintaining software applications.

Here are some common roles and responsibilities within the software development lifecycle:

1. **Business Analyst**: Responsible for understanding the client's requirements and translating them into functional specifications for the development team.

2. **Project Manager**: Oversees the entire software development project, including planning, resource allocation, scheduling, and coordinating different teams or individuals involved.

3. **Software Architect**: Designs the overall structure and system architecture of the software, ensuring that it meets the required technical standards and aligns with the project's goals.

4. **UI/UX Designer**: Creates the user interface and user experience design for the software, focusing on usability, visual aesthetics, and interaction flow.

5. **Software Developer/Engineer**: Writes the code to implement the software's functionality based on the requirements and design specifications provided. This role may be further divided into front-end developers, back-end developers, and full-stack developers, depending on the nature of the project.

6. **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**: Conducts testing and quality assurance activities to identify and fix bugs, ensure software functionality, and validate that it meets the desired quality standards.

7. **DevOps Engineer**: Responsible for setting up and managing the infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and automated processes for software development, including version control, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and system monitoring.

8. **Technical Writer**: Creates documentation, user manuals, and guides to assist users in understanding and utilizing the software effectively.

9. **Support and Maintenance**: Provides ongoing support, bug fixes, updates, and maintenance for the software after it is deployed to ensure its smooth operation and address any issues that may arise.

It's important to note that these roles can vary depending on the organization and project size. In smaller teams or startups, individuals may have to take on multiple roles, while larger organizations might have dedicated teams for each responsibility.

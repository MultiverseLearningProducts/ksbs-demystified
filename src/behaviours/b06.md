The behavior of "showing initiative and taking responsibility for solving
problems within their own remit, being resourceful when faced with a problem to
solve" refers to the proactive and independent approach that an apprentice
software developer should display in their work. Here's what it means:

1. **Initiative**: It means taking the lead and showing a proactive attitude
   towards identifying and addressing problems or tasks without waiting for
   explicit instructions. The apprentice developer should actively seek out
   opportunities to contribute, propose ideas, and take actions to improve their
   work or the overall project.

2. **Responsibility**: It involves taking ownership of tasks assigned to them
   and being accountable for their outcomes. The apprentice developer should
   recognize their responsibilities and ensure that they fulfill their
   commitments. They should also be aware of the boundaries of their role and
   focus on solving problems within their assigned area or scope.

3. **Problem-solving**: This refers to the ability to analyze and resolve
   challenges or obstacles that arise during software development. The
   apprentice developer should actively engage in problem-solving activities,
   utilizing their technical skills and knowledge to find effective solutions.
   They should approach problems with a systematic mindset, breaking them down
   into manageable parts and applying logical thinking to arrive at solutions.

4. **Resourcefulness**: Being resourceful means using available tools,
   references, and information effectively to solve problems. Rather than
   relying solely on others for assistance, the apprentice developer should
   demonstrate the ability to explore and leverage resources at their disposal,
   such as online documentation, forums, or relevant literature, to find
   solutions independently.

The behavior of showing initiative and taking responsibility for problem-solving
involves being proactive, accountable, and self-reliant in identifying and
resolving issues within one's assigned responsibilities as an apprentice
software developer.

| Portfolio | Illustrates how they have responded to the business context with curiosity to  explore new opportunities and techniques with tenacity to improve solution performance, establishing an approach to methods and solutions which reflects a determination to succeed. (B8) | NA |

The behavior you mentioned for an apprentice software developer can be
summarized as follows:

1. **Curiosity about the business context**: It means showing an interest and
   curiosity in understanding the specific environment, industry, or domain in
   which the software solution will be implemented. The developer should seek to
   understand how the solution fits into the larger picture, what challenges or
   requirements exist, and how it can add value to the business.

2. **Inquisitive approach to problem-solving**: This refers to being curious and
   inquiring when it comes to solving problems. Instead of settling for the
   first solution that comes to mind, the developer should explore different
   possibilities, ask questions, and dig deeper to gain a comprehensive
   understanding of the problem at hand. They should strive to uncover
   alternative approaches and consider different perspectives.

3. **Exploration of new opportunities and techniques**: It involves actively
   seeking out and exploring new opportunities and techniques within the field
   of software development. This can include staying updated with the latest
   industry trends, tools, and technologies, attending conferences or workshops,
   participating in online communities, and experimenting with new methods. The
   developer should have a growth mindset and be open to learning and adopting
   new practices.

4. **Tenacity to improve methods and maximize performance**: This implies having
   a strong drive to continuously improve and optimize the methods and processes
   used in developing software solutions. The developer should actively seek
   ways to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and overall performance of their
   code. They should be willing to experiment with different approaches, gather
   feedback, and iterate on their solutions to achieve better results.

5. **Creativity in approach to solutions**: It means thinking outside the box
   and coming up with innovative and creative solutions to problems. The
   developer should not be limited by conventional thinking but instead, explore
   unconventional or unique approaches when appropriate. They should be able to
   identify opportunities for innovation and apply their creative thinking to
   develop novel solutions.

These behaviors demonstrate that the apprentice software developer is not only
technically skilled but also possesses a mindset of curiosity, continuous
improvement, and creative problem-solving. They are proactive in understanding
the business context, exploring new possibilities, and finding ways to enhance
the performance and effectiveness of their solutions.

# B7: communicates effectively in a variety of situations to both a technical and non-technical audience

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

"Communicating effectively in a variety of situations to both a technical and non-technical audience" means that the apprentice software developer can convey information, ideas, and concepts clearly and efficiently, adapting their communication style to suit different types of people.

Here's a breakdown of what it entails:

1. **Clarity of communication**: The apprentice software developer should be able to articulate complex technical concepts in a way that is easily understood by both technical and non-technical individuals. They should avoid using jargon or overly technical terms when speaking to non-technical individuals, while still providing accurate and comprehensive information.

2. **Adaptability**: The apprentice should have the ability to adjust their communication style and approach based on the audience they are addressing. When speaking with technical team members or developers, they can dive into more technical details and use appropriate terminology. However, when interacting with non-technical stakeholders, such as project managers or clients, they should explain concepts using plain language and focus on the practical implications rather than the technical intricacies.

3. **Active listening**: Effective communication involves not just speaking but also listening attentively. The apprentice should actively listen to others' questions, concerns, or feedback, regardless of their technical proficiency, and respond appropriately. This includes asking clarifying questions to ensure they understand the other person's perspective and addressing any misunderstandings.

4. **Empathy**: Understanding the perspective of the audience is crucial for effective communication. The apprentice should put themselves in the shoes of the listener and consider their level of technical knowledge, interests, and needs. By doing so, they can tailor their communication to make it more relatable and relevant to the audience, fostering better understanding and engagement.

5. **Presentation skills**: The apprentice should be able to present information effectively in different formats, such as written reports, presentations, or informal discussions. They should organize their thoughts logically, use visual aids or examples when necessary, and deliver their message in a confident and engaging manner.

6. **Conflict resolution**: In some situations, effective communication may involve navigating conflicts or disagreements. The apprentice should be able to handle such situations diplomatically, actively listening to all parties involved, finding common ground, and facilitating constructive discussions to reach a resolution.

Demonstrating these behaviors shows that the apprentice software developer can effectively convey technical information, collaborate with different stakeholders, and ensure that their messages are understood by both technical and non-technical audiences.

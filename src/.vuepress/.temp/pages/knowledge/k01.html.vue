<p>The software development life cycle (SDLC) refers to the process followed to develop software applications. It consists of various stages or phases that help ensure the successful planning, creation, deployment, and maintenance of software systems. Here are the typical stages of the SDLC, along with their inputs and outputs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Requirements Gathering</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: User needs, business requirements, system constraints, and other relevant information.</li>
<li>Outputs: Software requirements specification document, which outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Analysis and Planning</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Requirements document, project scope, and available resources.</li>
<li>Outputs: System design document, project plan, and schedule. This stage involves analyzing the requirements, identifying potential risks, and planning the development process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Design</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: System design document, functional requirements, and design guidelines.</li>
<li>Outputs: Detailed design documents, such as architecture diagrams, database schema, and user interface mockups. This stage focuses on creating a blueprint for the software, including its structure and components.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Implementation or Coding</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Detailed design documents, programming languages, and development tools.</li>
<li>Outputs: Executable code or software modules that implement the specified functionality. This stage involves writing the actual code, following coding standards and best practices.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Software modules, test cases, and test data.</li>
<li>Outputs: Test results, defect reports, and documentation. This stage involves executing tests to identify and fix bugs, validate the software against the requirements, and ensure its quality and reliability.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployment</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Tested and approved software, deployment environment, and user documentation.</li>
<li>Outputs: Installed software or released product, user manuals, and installation guides. This stage involves deploying the software to the production environment, making it available for end-users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Maintenance and Support</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inputs: Deployed software, user feedback, and change requests.</li>
<li>Outputs: Bug fixes, updates, and enhancements. This stage involves addressing issues reported by users, making necessary updates or enhancements, and providing ongoing support for the software.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important for an apprentice software developer to understand each stage of the SDLC, the inputs required for each stage, and the expected outputs. This knowledge helps ensure that the developer can contribute effectively to the software development process and deliver high-quality software products.</p>

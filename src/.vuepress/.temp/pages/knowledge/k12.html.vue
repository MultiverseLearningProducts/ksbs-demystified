<ul>
<li>[ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;Software testing frameworks and methodologies&quot; refer to the tools and techniques used in the process of testing software applications to ensure their quality and reliability. As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating knowledge in this area would involve understanding and being able to apply various frameworks and methodologies for testing software.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing Frameworks</strong>: These are pre-defined structures or platforms that provide a foundation for organizing and executing software tests. Some popular testing frameworks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JUnit</strong>: A framework for testing Java applications.</li>
<li><strong>Pytest</strong>: A testing framework for Python applications.</li>
<li><strong>RSpec</strong>: A testing framework for Ruby applications.</li>
<li><strong>Selenium</strong>: A framework for web application testing.</li>
<li><strong>Cucumber</strong>: A behavior-driven development (BDD) framework that allows tests to be written in a human-readable format.</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding these frameworks involves knowing how to write test cases, execute tests, and interpret the results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing Methodologies</strong>: These are systematic approaches to testing software, which help ensure that all aspects of the software are thoroughly tested. Some common testing methodologies include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unit Testing</strong>: Testing individual units or components of the software to verify their correctness.</li>
<li><strong>Integration Testing</strong>: Testing the interaction between different modules or components to ensure they work together correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Functional Testing</strong>: Testing the functionality of the software to ensure it meets the specified requirements.</li>
<li><strong>Regression Testing</strong>: Repeating tests on previously tested software to ensure that changes or fixes have not introduced new issues.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Testing</strong>: Evaluating the performance of the software under various conditions to identify bottlenecks or areas for improvement.</li>
<li><strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</strong>: Testing the software with end-users to ensure it meets their expectations and requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Being familiar with these methodologies involves understanding their objectives, techniques, and best practices for implementation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In order to demonstrate knowledge in software testing frameworks and methodologies, an apprentice software developer should be able to explain the purpose and usage of different testing frameworks, demonstrate the ability to write effective test cases, understand the various testing methodologies and when to apply them, and showcase practical experience in executing tests and interpreting the results.</p>

</ul>
<p>To &quot;apply structured techniques to problem solving, debug code, and understand the structure of programs in order to identify and resolve issues&quot; means that an apprentice software developer should possess the following skills and abilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Structured problem-solving techniques</strong>: This involves approaching problems in a systematic and organized manner. It includes skills such as breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, defining the problem clearly, analyzing requirements, designing appropriate solutions, and evaluating potential alternatives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Debugging code</strong>: Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in software code. It requires the ability to understand the code and its intended behavior, identify where the code deviates from the desired outcome, and use tools and techniques to trace the source of the issue. Debugging also involves testing and verifying fixes to ensure they resolve the problem effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Understanding program structure</strong>: This refers to the ability to comprehend the architecture, design patterns, and organization of software programs. It involves understanding how different components/modules of a program interact with each other, the flow of data and control between different parts of the program, and the dependencies and relationships among various elements. This understanding enables the developer to navigate and analyze the codebase effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Issue identification and resolution</strong>: This skill involves the ability to identify and analyze issues or errors in code or program behavior. It requires a deep understanding of programming concepts, programming languages, and common software development practices. The developer should be able to pinpoint the root cause of the problem and propose appropriate solutions or fixes to resolve the issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>An apprentice software developer demonstrating these skills can effectively approach problem-solving, efficiently diagnose and fix code issues, and have a solid understanding of program structure, enabling them to contribute to the development and maintenance of software applications.</p>

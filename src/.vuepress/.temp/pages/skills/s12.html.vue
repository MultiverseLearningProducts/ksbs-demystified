<ul>
<li>[ ] Assessment method 1: Work-based project with questioning</li>
</ul>
<p>To &quot;follow software designs and functional or technical specifications&quot; means that an apprentice software developer should be able to understand and adhere to the instructions and guidelines provided in software designs and specifications documents. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts involved:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Software Designs</strong>: Software designs refer to the architectural and structural plans that outline how a software system should be organized, its components, and their interactions. It includes diagrams, flowcharts, data models, and other visual representations that depict the intended structure and behavior of the software.</li>
</ol>
<p>When asked to follow software designs, the apprentice developer should carefully study and comprehend these design documents. They should understand how different software components fit together, the relationships between various modules, and the expected flow of data and control within the system.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Functional Specifications</strong>: Functional specifications describe the expected behavior and functionality of a software system. They outline the features, capabilities, and interactions that the software should exhibit to meet the requirements of the users or stakeholders. Functional specifications provide a detailed description of the inputs, outputs, and expected behavior of the software in various scenarios.</li>
</ol>
<p>The apprentice developer should thoroughly analyze the functional specifications and ensure they understand the desired behavior of the software. They should be able to translate the specifications into code by implementing the required features and functionalities accurately.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Technical Specifications</strong>: Technical specifications focus on the technical aspects of the software, including the programming languages, frameworks, libraries, and other tools to be used. They provide guidelines on coding standards, naming conventions, database schemas, APIs, and other technical considerations.</li>
</ol>
<p>When following technical specifications, the apprentice developer should adhere to the recommended programming practices and standards specified in the document. This includes writing code that aligns with the prescribed style, using the specified technologies, and following any architectural or technical guidelines provided.</p>
<p>The ability to follow software designs and specifications demonstrates that the apprentice developer can comprehend and interpret the documentation provided for a software project. They should be capable of understanding the intended structure, behavior, and functionality of the software, and implementing the necessary code accordingly.</p>

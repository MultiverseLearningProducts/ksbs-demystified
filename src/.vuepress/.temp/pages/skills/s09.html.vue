</ul>
<p>Creating analysis artifacts, such as use cases and/or user stories, is an essential aspect of software development. These artifacts help in understanding and documenting the requirements and functionalities of a software system. Let's take a closer look at each of these artifacts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Use Cases</strong>:
Use cases are a way to describe the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a software system. They outline the steps or actions performed by the user or system to achieve a specific goal. Use cases typically consist of a title, a description of the scenario, preconditions, postconditions, and the steps involved in the interaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating your ability to create use cases involves identifying the different actors involved, understanding their goals, and documenting the specific interactions and steps required to accomplish those goals. Use cases provide a high-level view of system behavior and can be used to drive the development process.</p>

<li><strong>User Stories</strong>:
User stories are concise, informal descriptions of a feature or functionality of a software system from the perspective of an end user. They are typically written in a specific format, such as &quot;As a <user role>, I want <feature> so that <benefit>.&quot; User stories focus on the user's needs and describe the desired functionality in a simple and understandable manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>To demonstrate your ability to create user stories, you should be able to identify the different user roles or personas that interact with the system and understand their requirements. You then express these requirements as user stories, capturing the essential functionality and the benefit it provides to the user. User stories are often used in Agile development methodologies as a means of capturing and prioritizing requirements.</p>
<p>As an apprentice software developer, creating analysis artifacts like use cases and user stories involves understanding user requirements, identifying actors or user roles, and documenting the interactions or functionalities required to meet those requirements. These artifacts help communicate and clarify the needs of the software system to the development team and stakeholders.</p>

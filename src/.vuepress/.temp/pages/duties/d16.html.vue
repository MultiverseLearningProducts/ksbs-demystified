<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Delivering a solution:</strong> Once the software has been coded and tested, it needs to be installed or deployed on the client's environment, which might be a set of servers or a cloud-based platform. This process could include steps like configuration, installation of necessary prerequisites, setting up databases, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suitably Documented:</strong> Good documentation is key to the successful deployment, usage, and future maintenance of software. This documentation might include user manuals, installation guides, API references, troubleshooting guides, etc. It should explain how to deploy and use the software, what each part of the software does, and how to resolve common problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Deployable Solution:</strong> A deployable solution is a version of the software that can be readily installed and run in the client's environment. This often takes the form of executable files, container images, or installable packages. Modern development often uses continuous integration / continuous deployment (CI/CD) practices to automate the creation of deployable solutions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>For their use:</strong> The solution delivered must be ready for use by the client or end-users. This not only implies that it meets the functional requirements as agreed upon but also that it's user-friendly, reliable, secure, and performs well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apprentice Software Developer's Duty:</strong> As an apprentice software developer, your role would involve contributing to this process under the guidance of more experienced team members. You may be responsible for helping to write the software, test it, document it, or aid in its deployment.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The obligation of the apprentice software developer is to ensure the software solution they have worked on is ready to be deployed successfully in the customer's environment and comes with all the necessary documentation for its use and maintenance.</p>

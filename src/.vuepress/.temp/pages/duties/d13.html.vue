<p>Change control in software development refers to the process of managing, tracking, and implementing alterations to the software in a systematic and efficient manner. The main goal of this process is to ensure that the changes do not have negative impacts on the functioning and quality of the software.</p>
<p>As an apprentice software developer, your responsibility might include the following aspects:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Change Request Process</strong>: Part of your responsibility could be understanding and contributing to the process of requesting changes. This typically involves identifying the need for a change, describing what the change is, and detailing its expected impact. These requests should be clearly documented for later reference.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Impact Analysis</strong>: Before a change is approved, you need to analyze the potential impact. How will this change affect other parts of the software? What are the potential risks? If the change could introduce new bugs or affect system performance, these factors need to be considered before the change is approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Approvals</strong>: Depending on the complexity and impact of the change, it may require approval from team leads, project managers, or other stakeholders. It's important to follow the established approval process for your team or organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Testing</strong>: Changes to the software should be thoroughly tested to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new problems. As an apprentice, you might be tasked with conducting these tests or assisting in the testing process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: Every change should be documented. This can include what the change was, why it was made, who approved it, when it was implemented, and any problems that arose as a result. This helps to track the evolution of the software over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Review and Audit</strong>: Periodically, you may need to participate in reviews of changes or audits of the change control process. This is to ensure the process is working as intended and to identify any potential areas for improvement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rollback Plan</strong>: For every change, a rollback plan should be in place in case the change has unintended consequences or introduces new problems. Part of implementing change control could involve creating these rollback plans.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All these steps ensure that the changes are beneficial, are implemented properly, and have minimal negative impact. They also help with managing and understanding the risk that inevitably comes with altering software. The degree to which you, as an apprentice developer, will be involved in each of these steps can vary greatly based on your team, the size of your organization, and the specific project or product you're working on.</p>

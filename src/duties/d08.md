# D8: consider security implications of proposed design to ensure that security considerations are built in from inception and throughout the development process.

Security isn't an afterthought or an aspect you add to the application at the end of the process. It should be an integral part of the design from the beginning and at every step of the development cycle. This is often referred to as "security by design" or "secure by design". Here's a more detailed look at what that might entail for an apprentice software developer:

1. **Understanding the Basics of Security**: Before incorporating security in software design, the developer must have a basic understanding of security concepts. This can include things like authentication, authorization, encryption, and principles such as least privilege and defense in depth.

2. **Risk Assessment**: An early step in the development process should be risk assessment, which involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities that could be exploited in the system. This requires understanding the data flow, potential entry points for attackers, and the value of the information or functionality that could be compromised.

3. **Security Requirements**: Based on the risk assessment, the developer can establish security requirements. These are specific measures that the software must meet to mitigate the identified risks. This could include, for example, requiring two-factor authentication for user logins, or using secure, up-to-date libraries and frameworks in the software.

4. **Secure Design**: Security considerations should inform the software's architecture and design. This means, for instance, isolating different parts of the system from each other to limit the potential impact of a security breach, or designing the system to fail securely in the event of an error or breach.

5. **Secure Coding**: The developer should follow secure coding practices, which help prevent common security vulnerabilities. This includes validating and sanitizing inputs, avoiding insecure functions or practices that could open up vulnerabilities, and handling errors in a way that doesn't reveal sensitive information.

6. **Security Testing**: Throughout the development process and after completion, the software should be tested for security vulnerabilities. This can include penetration testing, where an attempt is made to breach the system, and code reviews to identify potential security issues.

7. **Security in Deployment and Maintenance**: Even after the software is deployed, security remains important. This means monitoring for security issues, regularly updating and patching the software to address new vulnerabilities, and having a plan in place to respond to security incidents.

Remember, as an apprentice developer, it's crucial to understand that everyone on the team is responsible for security, not just the "security experts". It's a continuous process that should always be part of your work. A secure mindset will help you avoid potential pitfalls and make your software more robust and secure for your users.

# D7: communicate software development solutions to a range of internal or external stakeholders to ensure clear understanding of requirements and how they have been met or adjusted.

The responsibility of an apprentice software developer to communicate software development solutions to various stakeholders can encompass several elements.

1. **Identify the stakeholders**: These could be internal stakeholders such as team members, project managers, product owners, UX designers, or other departments within the organization. External stakeholders may include clients, third-party vendors, or users of the software. Each stakeholder group may have different concerns and levels of technical expertise.

2. **Understand the requirements**: The developer needs to grasp what the software is expected to do, which includes both functional and non-functional requirements. They need to understand the problem that the software is meant to solve and the needs of the users.

3. **Propose solutions**: Once the developer has a clear understanding of the requirements, they will develop a solution that addresses these needs. This solution could involve coding new software, modifying existing software, or integrating third-party solutions.

4. **Communicate the solution**: This is where the developer explains to the stakeholders how the solution works and how it meets their requirements. The developer must be able to communicate complex technical concepts in a manner that is easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand. This could involve creating diagrams, giving presentations, or writing reports.

5. **Gather feedback and adjust**: After presenting the solution, the developer should listen to feedback from the stakeholders. There may be aspects of the solution that don't fully meet the requirements, or there might be new requirements that have arisen. The developer should then adjust the solution based on this feedback.

6. **Verify and validate the solution**: Once the solution has been adjusted, the developer should verify that it works correctly and validate that it meets the requirements. This may involve testing the software, reviewing the code, or running simulations.

7. **Document the solution**: Finally, the developer should document how the solution works and how it meets the requirements. This documentation can be used by other developers, by users of the software, and by the stakeholders to understand the solution.

This duty emphasizes that software development is not just about coding; it's also about communication and collaboration. It's about understanding problems, proposing solutions, and explaining these solutions in a way that everyone involved can understand.

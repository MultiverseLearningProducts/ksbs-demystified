# D20: apply suitable 'bug fix', appropriate to the severity and priority of the software development issue identified.

The process of dealing with bugs in software development is a crucial one, and it involves several steps including prioritizing the severity of the bug, investigating the cause, applying a fix, and testing to ensure the fix worked as expected.

1. **Understanding the Issue:** The first step is understanding what the problem is. This involves reproducing the bug, understanding the expected versus the actual behavior of the software, and documenting the steps to reproduce the issue.

2. **Prioritization:** Next, the developer needs to prioritize the issue. This is typically done by considering the severity of the bug, its impact on users, and the complexity of fixing it. Severity can be classified as:

   - **Critical:** The bug causes a failure of the complete software system, subsystem or a program within the system.
   - **High:** The bug does not cause a failure, but causes the system to produce incorrect, incomplete, or inconsistent results.
   - **Medium:** The bug does not cause a failure, does not damage the usability of the system, and the desired results can be easily obtained by working around the bugs.
   - **Low:** The bug is an aesthetic, is an enhancement or is helpful but not necessary.

   Similarly, bugs are also classified based on their priority:

   - **P1:** Must be fixed immediately.
   - **P2:** High priority, plan for fix as soon as possible.
   - **P3:** Medium priority, fix if time.
   - **P4:** Low priority, fix when possible.

3. **Investigating the Issue:** Once the bug has been prioritized, it's time to find the root cause. This might involve debugging the code, examining logs, or even discussing the issue with other team members. The developer should also consider whether this bug might be present in other parts of the codebase.

4. **Fixing the Bug:** After finding the root cause, the developer should create a plan to fix the bug. This might be a simple code change, or it could require more significant architecture changes. The developer should ensure that the fix doesn't introduce new bugs by considering the potential impacts on the rest of the system.

5. **Testing the Fix:** After the bug has been fixed, it's essential to test the solution to ensure the issue has been resolved without causing any other problems. This might involve unit tests, integration tests, or manual testing, depending on the situation.

6. **Review and Deployment:** Before the fix is deployed, it should be reviewed by peers. Code review can catch potential issues and promote shared understanding of the codebase. After approval in the review, the fix can be deployed to the production environment.

7. **Post-Mortem Analysis:** Especially for high-severity bugs, it's beneficial to conduct a post-mortem analysis to understand why the bug occurred, how it slipped past testing, and how similar bugs can be prevented in the future.

By understanding and following this process, an apprentice software developer can effectively handle bugs and contribute to the overall quality of the software system.

# D15: perform testing of the software solution to ensure a high quality output (Software Development Lifecycle -Test phase).

Software testing is a crucial phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that helps ensure the quality, functionality, and reliability of software before it is released. Here are some key aspects of the testing phase:

1. **Types of Testing**: There are several types of testing that a software solution should undergo.

   - **Unit Testing**: This is the process of testing individual units of source code to determine if they are fit for use.
   - **Integration Testing**: This process involves combining individual units and testing them as a group.
   - **System Testing**: In system testing, the entire system is tested as per the requirements. It's a series of different tests whose sole purpose is to evaluate the systemâ€™s compliance with the specified needs.
   - **Acceptance Testing**: This testing, also known as beta testing, is performed by the customers, and it is final testing before releasing the application for commercial purpose.

2. **Test Plans and Cases**: A Test Plan is a detailed document that describes the test strategy, objectives, schedule, estimation, deliverables, and resources required for testing. Test cases are specific conditions under which a tester will determine whether an application, software system, or feature is working correctly.

3. **Manual and Automated Testing**: Testing can be done manually, but it is also common to automate testing as much as possible. Automated testing tools can be used to write scripts that carry out the tests and report results, saving time and avoiding human error.

4. **Regression Testing**: Whenever changes are made to the code, regression testing is done to make sure that the changes haven't broken any existing functionality.

5. **Bug Tracking**: If issues are found during testing, they will be documented and returned to the developers. This process continues until the product reaches the desired quality level.

6. **Performance Testing**: This is done to check how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It can also serve to investigate, measure, validate or verify other quality attributes of the system, such as scalability, reliability, and resource usage.

An apprentice software developer involved in testing will likely be involved in writing and executing test cases, reporting bugs, and possibly writing automated tests. Their goal is to find and report any issues with the software, to ensure that the final product is as high-quality, functional, and user-friendly as possible. This process can require a lot of creativity, as it involves thinking of all the ways that a user might interact with the program, including ways that the developers may not have anticipated. It's a very important step in the software development process.

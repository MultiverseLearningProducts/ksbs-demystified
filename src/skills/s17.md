# S17: interpret and implement a given design whist remaining compliant with security and maintainability requirements

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

Interpreting and implementing a given design while remaining compliant with security and maintainability requirements refers to the ability of an apprentice software developer to understand and execute a software design provided to them, while ensuring that the resulting software meets specific criteria related to security and maintainability.

1. **Interpreting a given design**: This involves comprehending the design specifications, which may include requirements, functional descriptions, user interface guidelines, and architectural diagrams. The apprentice software developer should be able to understand the intended behavior and purpose of the software based on these design documents.

2. **Implementing the design**: Once the design is understood, the apprentice software developer needs to translate it into actual code or develop the software according to the design specifications. This includes writing code, creating user interfaces, integrating different components, and implementing required functionalities.

3. **Complying with security requirements**: Security is a crucial aspect of software development. The apprentice should ensure that the implemented software is designed and developed with appropriate security measures in place. This may involve following secure coding practices, implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting sensitive data, and preventing common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks, cross-site scripting, or insecure configurations.

4. **Complying with maintainability requirements**: Maintainability refers to the ease with which software can be modified, extended, and debugged in the future. The apprentice software developer should ensure that the code they write is maintainable by following coding conventions, using proper documentation, employing modular and structured programming techniques, and writing clean, readable, and well-organized code. They should also consider factors like code reusability, scalability, and performance optimization.

The apprentice software developer should demonstrate their ability to understand and implement a provided design, while considering security aspects to protect the software and its users, as well as ensuring that the resulting software is maintainable for future development and enhancement.

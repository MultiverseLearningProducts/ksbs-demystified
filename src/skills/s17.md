| Portfolio | Explains, how they have interpreted and implemented a given design whilst remaining compliant with security and maintainability requirements. (S17) | NA |

Interpreting and implementing a given design while remaining compliant with
security and maintainability requirements refers to the ability of an apprentice
software developer to understand and execute a software design provided to them,
while ensuring that the resulting software meets specific criteria related to
security and maintainability.

1. **Interpreting a given design**: This involves comprehending the design
   specifications, which may include requirements, functional descriptions, user
   interface guidelines, and architectural diagrams. The apprentice software
   developer should be able to understand the intended behavior and purpose of
   the software based on these design documents.

2. **Implementing the design**: Once the design is understood, the apprentice
   software developer needs to translate it into actual code or develop the
   software according to the design specifications. This includes writing code,
   creating user interfaces, integrating different components, and implementing
   required functionalities.

3. **Complying with security requirements**: Security is a crucial aspect of
   software development. The apprentice should ensure that the implemented
   software is designed and developed with appropriate security measures in
   place. This may involve following secure coding practices, implementing
   authentication and authorization mechanisms, protecting sensitive data, and
   preventing common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks, cross-site
   scripting, or insecure configurations.

4. **Complying with maintainability requirements**: Maintainability refers to
   the ease with which software can be modified, extended, and debugged in the
   future. The apprentice software developer should ensure that the code they
   write is maintainable by following coding conventions, using proper
   documentation, employing modular and structured programming techniques, and
   writing clean, readable, and well-organized code. They should also consider
   factors like code reusability, scalability, and performance optimization.

The apprentice software developer should demonstrate their ability to understand
and implement a provided design, while considering security aspects to protect
the software and its users, as well as ensuring that the resulting software is
maintainable for future development and enhancement.

| Work-based project | Applies structured techniques to problem solving to identify and resolve issues and debug basic flaws in code. (S7)  | Analyses the software to identify and debug complex issues using a fix that provides a permanent solution. (S7) |

To "apply structured techniques to problem solving, debug code, and understand
the structure of programs in order to identify and resolve issues" means that an
apprentice software developer should possess the following skills and abilities:

1. **Structured problem-solving techniques**: This involves approaching problems
   in a systematic and organized manner. It includes skills such as breaking
   down complex problems into smaller, more manageable parts, defining the
   problem clearly, analyzing requirements, designing appropriate solutions, and
   evaluating potential alternatives.

2. **Debugging code**: Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors
   or bugs in software code. It requires the ability to understand the code and
   its intended behavior, identify where the code deviates from the desired
   outcome, and use tools and techniques to trace the source of the issue.
   Debugging also involves testing and verifying fixes to ensure they resolve
   the problem effectively.

3. **Understanding program structure**: This refers to the ability to comprehend
   the architecture, design patterns, and organization of software programs. It
   involves understanding how different components/modules of a program interact
   with each other, the flow of data and control between different parts of the
   program, and the dependencies and relationships among various elements. This
   understanding enables the developer to navigate and analyze the codebase
   effectively.

4. **Issue identification and resolution**: This skill involves the ability to
   identify and analyze issues or errors in code or program behavior. It
   requires a deep understanding of programming concepts, programming languages,
   and common software development practices. The developer should be able to
   pinpoint the root cause of the problem and propose appropriate solutions or
   fixes to resolve the issue.

An apprentice software developer demonstrating these skills can effectively
approach problem-solving, efficiently diagnose and fix code issues, and have a
solid understanding of program structure, enabling them to contribute to the
development and maintenance of software applications.

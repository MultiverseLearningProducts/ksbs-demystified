"Following testing frameworks and methodologies" refers to the ability of an
apprentice software developer to adhere to established practices and processes
for software testing. It involves understanding and applying standardized
approaches to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. Here are
some key elements typically associated with testing frameworks and
methodologies:

1. **Test Planning**: Developing a comprehensive test plan that outlines the
   scope, objectives, and strategies for testing.

2. **Test Design**: Creating test cases and test scenarios based on functional
   and non-functional requirements, system specifications, and user
   expectations.

3. **Test Execution**: Running the defined tests, recording the outcomes, and
   comparing the actual results against expected results.

4. **Defect Management**: Reporting and tracking software defects or issues
   found during testing, including documenting steps to reproduce the problem
   and providing relevant information to developers for resolution.

5. **Test Automation**: Utilizing automated testing tools and frameworks to
   streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.

6. **Regression Testing**: Repeating tests on modified or updated software to
   ensure that changes do not introduce new defects or impact existing
   functionality.

7. **Performance Testing**: Assessing the performance and responsiveness of
   software under different load conditions to identify bottlenecks or
   performance issues.

8. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing**: Integrating testing into
   the software development lifecycle by automating testing and incorporating it
   into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

9. **Test Documentation**: Creating and maintaining documentation related to
   testing activities, including test plans, test cases, test scripts, and test
   reports.

10. **Collaboration**: Collaborating with other team members, such as
    developers, product owners, and quality assurance professionals, to
    understand requirements, prioritize testing efforts, and communicate test
    results effectively.

Demonstrating the ability to follow testing frameworks and methodologies implies
that the apprentice software developer can understand and apply these concepts
in practice, following established guidelines and best practices to ensure
effective testing of software applications.

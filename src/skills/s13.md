# S13: follow testing frameworks and methodologies

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

"Following testing frameworks and methodologies" refers to the ability of an apprentice software developer to adhere to established practices and processes for software testing. It involves understanding and applying standardized approaches to ensure the quality and reliability of software products. Here are some key elements typically associated with testing frameworks and methodologies:

1. **Test Planning**: Developing a comprehensive test plan that outlines the scope, objectives, and strategies for testing.

2. **Test Design**: Creating test cases and test scenarios based on functional and non-functional requirements, system specifications, and user expectations.

3. **Test Execution**: Running the defined tests, recording the outcomes, and comparing the actual results against expected results.

4. **Defect Management**: Reporting and tracking software defects or issues found during testing, including documenting steps to reproduce the problem and providing relevant information to developers for resolution.

5. **Test Automation**: Utilizing automated testing tools and frameworks to streamline the testing process and improve efficiency.

6. **Regression Testing**: Repeating tests on modified or updated software to ensure that changes do not introduce new defects or impact existing functionality.

7. **Performance Testing**: Assessing the performance and responsiveness of software under different load conditions to identify bottlenecks or performance issues.

8. **Continuous Integration and Continuous Testing**: Integrating testing into the software development lifecycle by automating testing and incorporating it into the continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

9. **Test Documentation**: Creating and maintaining documentation related to testing activities, including test plans, test cases, test scripts, and test reports.

10. **Collaboration**: Collaborating with other team members, such as developers, product owners, and quality assurance professionals, to understand requirements, prioritize testing efforts, and communicate test results effectively.

Demonstrating the ability to follow testing frameworks and methodologies implies that the apprentice software developer can understand and apply these concepts in practice, following established guidelines and best practices to ensure effective testing of software applications.

Creating analysis artifacts, such as use cases and/or user stories, is an
essential aspect of software development. These artifacts help in understanding
and documenting the requirements and functionalities of a software system. Let's
take a closer look at each of these artifacts:

1. **Use Cases**: Use cases are a way to describe the interactions between
   actors (users or external systems) and a software system. They outline the
   steps or actions performed by the user or system to achieve a specific goal.
   Use cases typically consist of a title, a description of the scenario,
   preconditions, postconditions, and the steps involved in the interaction.

As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating your ability to create use
cases involves identifying the different actors involved, understanding their
goals, and documenting the specific interactions and steps required to
accomplish those goals. Use cases provide a high-level view of system behavior
and can be used to drive the development process.

2. **User Stories**: User stories are concise, informal descriptions of a
   feature or functionality of a software system from the perspective of an end
   user. They are typically written in a specific format, such as "As a
   `<user role>`, I want `<feature>` so that `<benefit>`." User stories focus on
   the user's needs and describe the desired functionality in a simple and
   understandable manner.

To demonstrate your ability to create user stories, you should be able to
identify the different user roles or personas that interact with the system and
understand their requirements. You then express these requirements as user
stories, capturing the essential functionality and the benefit it provides to
the user. User stories are often used in Agile development methodologies as a
means of capturing and prioritizing requirements.

As an apprentice software developer, creating analysis artifacts like use cases
and user stories involves understanding user requirements, identifying actors or
user roles, and documenting the interactions or functionalities required to meet
those requirements. These artifacts help communicate and clarify the needs of
the software system to the development team and stakeholders.

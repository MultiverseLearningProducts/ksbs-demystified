To "create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of
the program" means that the apprentice software developer should be able to
visually represent their understanding of a program's structure, components, and
relationships using appropriate design techniques. This demonstration helps
communicate their comprehension of the software and how it should be organized
and implemented.

Here are some key points to consider when creating software designs to
effectively communicate understanding:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: The designs should be clear, concise, and easy to
   comprehend. Avoid unnecessary complexity or convoluted representations that
   may confuse others.

2. **Visual Diagrams**: Utilize visual diagrams such as flowcharts, UML diagrams
   (e.g., class diagrams, sequence diagrams), or other appropriate visual
   representations. These diagrams should illustrate the overall architecture,
   modules, classes, interfaces, and their interactions.

3. **Modularity and Structure**: Emphasize the modular structure of the
   software, highlighting the individual components, their responsibilities, and
   how they interact with each other. This helps convey a clear understanding of
   the program's organization and hierarchy.

4. **Documentation**: Accompany the software designs with concise and
   explanatory documentation, describing the purpose of each component, the flow
   of data or control, and any assumptions or constraints.

5. **Consider User Experience**: If relevant, incorporate elements of user
   interface (UI) or user experience (UX) design into the software designs. This
   can help convey an understanding of how users will interact with the program
   and demonstrate thoughtfulness in designing intuitive interfaces.

6. **Version Control and Collaboration**: If appropriate, demonstrate an
   understanding of version control systems (e.g., Git) by using them to track
   changes in the software designs. This showcases familiarity with
   industry-standard practices and collaboration techniques.

By effectively communicating their understanding of the program through simple
software designs, the apprentice software developer demonstrates their ability
to organize and convey software concepts, collaborate with others, and think
critically about the architecture and implementation of a software system.

# S8: create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

To "create simple software designs to effectively communicate understanding of the program" means that the apprentice software developer should be able to visually represent their understanding of a program's structure, components, and relationships using appropriate design techniques. This demonstration helps communicate their comprehension of the software and how it should be organized and implemented.

Here are some key points to consider when creating software designs to effectively communicate understanding:

1. **Clarity and Simplicity**: The designs should be clear, concise, and easy to comprehend. Avoid unnecessary complexity or convoluted representations that may confuse others.

2. **Visual Diagrams**: Utilize visual diagrams such as flowcharts, UML diagrams (e.g., class diagrams, sequence diagrams), or other appropriate visual representations. These diagrams should illustrate the overall architecture, modules, classes, interfaces, and their interactions.

3. **Modularity and Structure**: Emphasize the modular structure of the software, highlighting the individual components, their responsibilities, and how they interact with each other. This helps convey a clear understanding of the program's organization and hierarchy.

4. **Documentation**: Accompany the software designs with concise and explanatory documentation, describing the purpose of each component, the flow of data or control, and any assumptions or constraints.

5. **Consider User Experience**: If relevant, incorporate elements of user interface (UI) or user experience (UX) design into the software designs. This can help convey an understanding of how users will interact with the program and demonstrate thoughtfulness in designing intuitive interfaces.

6. **Version Control and Collaboration**: If appropriate, demonstrate an understanding of version control systems (e.g., Git) by using them to track changes in the software designs. This showcases familiarity with industry-standard practices and collaboration techniques.

By effectively communicating their understanding of the program through simple software designs, the apprentice software developer demonstrates their ability to organize and convey software concepts, collaborate with others, and think critically about the architecture and implementation of a software system.

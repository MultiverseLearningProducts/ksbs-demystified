"Following company, team, or client approaches to continuous integration,
version control, and source control" refers to the ability of an apprentice
software developer to adhere to the established practices and workflows related
to these essential software development processes within the organization.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Continuous Integration is a development
   practice that involves frequently integrating code changes from multiple
   developers into a shared repository. An apprentice software developer should
   demonstrate their understanding of CI principles, such as regularly
   committing code, integrating changes with the main codebase, and ensuring
   that automated tests are run to detect any issues early on.

2. **Version Control**: Version control is the management of changes to source
   code over time. It involves using a version control system (e.g., Git,
   Subversion) to track and organize code modifications, enabling collaboration
   and facilitating the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary. The
   apprentice developer should showcase their ability to work with version
   control systems effectively, including committing changes, branching and
   merging code, resolving conflicts, and understanding the basic concepts of
   version control.

3. **Source Control**: Source control, often used interchangeably with version
   control, encompasses the practices and tools employed to manage source code
   files and related artifacts. This includes not only the versioning of code
   but also managing the overall structure and organization of the codebase,
   documenting changes, and ensuring that the code is accessible and
   well-maintained.

To demonstrate proficiency in these areas, the apprentice software developer
should be able to:

- Familiarize themselves with the specific tools and systems used by the
  company, team, or client for version control and source control.
- Understand and adhere to the established workflows and conventions for
  committing code changes, such as commit message guidelines and code review
  processes.
- Collaborate effectively with other team members by following branching and
  merging strategies, resolving conflicts, and integrating code changes
  smoothly.
- Utilize continuous integration tools and processes, such as configuring build
  pipelines or writing automated tests, to ensure that changes are tested and
  integrated seamlessly into the codebase.
- Document their work, including keeping track of changes made, maintaining a
  changelog, and contributing to relevant documentation or knowledge sharing
  platforms.

By demonstrating their ability to follow these approaches, the apprentice
software developer shows that they are capable of working collaboratively,
following established practices, and ensuring that the codebase remains
organized, manageable, and well-documented.

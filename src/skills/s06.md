# S6: identify and create test scenarios

- [ ] Assessment method 1: Work-based project with questioning

Identifying and creating test scenarios refers to the ability of a software developer to analyse a software system or feature and determine the various situations, conditions, or inputs that need to be tested in order to ensure the software's quality and functionality.

Test scenarios are a set of conditions or steps that describe how a particular feature or functionality of the software should behave under different circumstances. They help verify that the software meets the specified requirements, functions correctly, and handles various edge cases appropriately.

As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating the ability to identify and create test scenarios involves the following:

1. **Requirement Analysis**: Understanding the software requirements and user expectations is crucial. Analyze the software's functional and non-functional requirements, user stories, design specifications, and any other relevant documentation.

2. **Test Case Identification**: Identify different features, functionalities, or use cases within the software that need to be tested. Break them down into smaller components or scenarios for focused testing.

3. **Input and Output Identification**: Determine the inputs that need to be provided to the software and the expected outputs or behaviors that should result from those inputs. Consider both normal and abnormal or edge case scenarios.

4. **Boundary and Error Testing**: Identify boundary conditions or limits for inputs, such as minimum and maximum values, and test how the software handles them. Also, consider error conditions, invalid inputs, and exception handling.

5. **Dependency and Integration Testing**: Identify any dependencies or interactions between different components or modules of the software and create test scenarios that ensure they function correctly together.

6. **Negative Testing**: Think about scenarios where the software should not behave as expected. Test how the software handles invalid inputs, edge cases, or unexpected conditions, ensuring appropriate error messages and graceful failure.

7. **Reproducing and Reporting Issues**: Consider scenarios that may have caused issues or bugs in the past. Create test scenarios that help reproduce those issues and verify that they have been fixed.

8. **Documentation**: Document the identified test scenarios clearly and concisely, including the steps to be followed, the expected results, and any additional information necessary to execute the tests.

9. **Collaboration and Communication**: As an apprentice, it is important to collaborate with team members, stakeholders, and experienced developers or testers. Communicate the identified test scenarios effectively and seek feedback or guidance when needed.

By demonstrating the ability to identify and create test scenarios, an apprentice software developer shows their understanding of software testing principles, attention to detail, and the ability to think critically about different software behaviors and conditions.

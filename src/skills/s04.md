# S4: test code and anylsing results to correct errors found using unit testing

- [ ] Assessment method 1: Work-based project with questioning

Employing a unit testing approch to test code and then analyse the results to correct errors found means that the apprentice software developer should be able to perform the following tasks:

1. **Unit Testing**: Unit testing is a software testing technique where individual components or units of code are tested in isolation. The developer should be able to write test cases that cover different scenarios and test the functionality of specific units or functions within the code.

2. **Test Code**: The developer needs to write test cases, which are code snippets specifically designed to verify the correctness of the code being tested. These test cases should cover various inputs, edge cases, and possible scenarios to ensure that the code behaves as expected.

3. **Analyze Results**: After running the unit tests, the developer needs to examine the results to identify any errors or failures. They should compare the actual output with the expected output defined in the test cases. If there are discrepancies, they need to analyze the results to understand the root cause of the errors.

4. **Correct Errors**: Once the errors are identified, the developer should investigate the cause of the errors and fix the code accordingly. This involves debugging the code to understand the problem and making the necessary changes to ensure the code functions correctly.

This competency demonstrates the developer's ability to write effective test cases, execute them, and analyze the results to identify and rectify errors, thus improving the overall quality and reliability of the software being developed.

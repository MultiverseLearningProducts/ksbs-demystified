To "follow software designs and functional or technical specifications" means
that an apprentice software developer should be able to understand and adhere to
the instructions and guidelines provided in software designs and specifications
documents. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts involved:

1. **Software Designs**: Software designs refer to the architectural and
   structural plans that outline how a software system should be organized, its
   components, and their interactions. It includes diagrams, flowcharts, data
   models, and other visual representations that depict the intended structure
   and behavior of the software.

When asked to follow software designs, the apprentice developer should carefully
study and comprehend these design documents. They should understand how
different software components fit together, the relationships between various
modules, and the expected flow of data and control within the system.

2. **Functional Specifications**: Functional specifications describe the
   expected behavior and functionality of a software system. They outline the
   features, capabilities, and interactions that the software should exhibit to
   meet the requirements of the users or stakeholders. Functional specifications
   provide a detailed description of the inputs, outputs, and expected behavior
   of the software in various scenarios.

The apprentice developer should thoroughly analyze the functional specifications
and ensure they understand the desired behavior of the software. They should be
able to translate the specifications into code by implementing the required
features and functionalities accurately.

3. **Technical Specifications**: Technical specifications focus on the technical
   aspects of the software, including the programming languages, frameworks,
   libraries, and other tools to be used. They provide guidelines on coding
   standards, naming conventions, database schemas, APIs, and other technical
   considerations.

When following technical specifications, the apprentice developer should adhere
to the recommended programming practices and standards specified in the
document. This includes writing code that aligns with the prescribed style,
using the specified technologies, and following any architectural or technical
guidelines provided.

The ability to follow software designs and specifications demonstrates that the
apprentice developer can comprehend and interpret the documentation provided for
a software project. They should be capable of understanding the intended
structure, behavior, and functionality of the software, and implementing the
necessary code accordingly.

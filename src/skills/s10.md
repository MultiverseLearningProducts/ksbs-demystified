# S10: build, manage and deploy code into the relevant environment

- [ ] Assessment method 1: Work-based project with questioning

To "build, manage, and deploy code into the relevant environment" refers to the process of developing software applications, handling their dependencies, and making them available for use in a specific computing environment. Let's break down each aspect:

1. **Building code**: Building code involves compiling or transforming the source code into a format that the computer or target environment can understand and execute. This typically includes tasks such as compiling code written in high-level programming languages into executable files or libraries. The specific build process depends on the programming language and tools used in the development workflow.

2. **Managing code**: Managing code entails organizing and versioning the software's source code, dependencies, and related assets. Version control systems like Git are commonly used to track changes, collaborate with others, and manage different versions or branches of the codebase. Proper code management ensures traceability, reproducibility, and facilitates collaboration among developers.

3. **Deploying code**: Deployment involves making the developed software available for use in a specific environment, such as a server, cloud platform, or a user's device. It encompasses tasks like configuring the deployment environment, setting up databases or other required services, and ensuring the application is accessible and functional in the target environment. Deployment processes can vary depending on the type of application and the chosen deployment strategy (e.g., manual deployment, continuous integration/continuous deployment pipelines, containerization, serverless computing, etc.).

The "relevant environment" mentioned in your question could refer to a specific platform, server, cloud infrastructure, or other computing environment where the software needs to be deployed and executed. This environment could be a local development machine, a testing server, a production server, or a cloud platform like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

As an apprentice software developer, demonstrating proficiency in building, managing, and deploying code into the relevant environment means showing competence in these fundamental aspects of software development and the ability to effectively bring a software application from development to a usable state in the intended environment.

# B6: shows initiative and takes responsibility for solving problems within their own remit, being resourceful when faced with a problem to solve

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

The behavior of "showing initiative and taking responsibility for solving problems within their own remit, being resourceful when faced with a problem to solve" refers to the proactive and independent approach that an apprentice software developer should display in their work. Here's what it means:

1. **Initiative**: It means taking the lead and showing a proactive attitude towards identifying and addressing problems or tasks without waiting for explicit instructions. The apprentice developer should actively seek out opportunities to contribute, propose ideas, and take actions to improve their work or the overall project.

2. **Responsibility**: It involves taking ownership of tasks assigned to them and being accountable for their outcomes. The apprentice developer should recognize their responsibilities and ensure that they fulfill their commitments. They should also be aware of the boundaries of their role and focus on solving problems within their assigned area or scope.

3. **Problem-solving**: This refers to the ability to analyze and resolve challenges or obstacles that arise during software development. The apprentice developer should actively engage in problem-solving activities, utilizing their technical skills and knowledge to find effective solutions. They should approach problems with a systematic mindset, breaking them down into manageable parts and applying logical thinking to arrive at solutions.

4. **Resourcefulness**: Being resourceful means using available tools, references, and information effectively to solve problems. Rather than relying solely on others for assistance, the apprentice developer should demonstrate the ability to explore and leverage resources at their disposal, such as online documentation, forums, or relevant literature, to find solutions independently.

The behavior of showing initiative and taking responsibility for problem-solving involves being proactive, accountable, and self-reliant in identifying and resolving issues within one's assigned responsibilities as an apprentice software developer.

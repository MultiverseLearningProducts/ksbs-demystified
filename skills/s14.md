# S14: follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

"Following company, team, or client approaches to continuous integration, version control, and source control" refers to the ability of an apprentice software developer to adhere to the established practices and workflows related to these essential software development processes within the organization.

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
   Continuous Integration is a development practice that involves frequently integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository. An apprentice software developer should demonstrate their understanding of CI principles, such as regularly committing code, integrating changes with the main codebase, and ensuring that automated tests are run to detect any issues early on.

2. **Version Control**:
   Version control is the management of changes to source code over time. It involves using a version control system (e.g., Git, Subversion) to track and organize code modifications, enabling collaboration and facilitating the ability to revert to previous versions if necessary. The apprentice developer should showcase their ability to work with version control systems effectively, including committing changes, branching and merging code, resolving conflicts, and understanding the basic concepts of version control.

3. **Source Control**:
   Source control, often used interchangeably with version control, encompasses the practices and tools employed to manage source code files and related artifacts. This includes not only the versioning of code but also managing the overall structure and organization of the codebase, documenting changes, and ensuring that the code is accessible and well-maintained.

To demonstrate proficiency in these areas, the apprentice software developer should be able to:

- Familiarize themselves with the specific tools and systems used by the company, team, or client for version control and source control.
- Understand and adhere to the established workflows and conventions for committing code changes, such as commit message guidelines and code review processes.
- Collaborate effectively with other team members by following branching and merging strategies, resolving conflicts, and integrating code changes smoothly.
- Utilize continuous integration tools and processes, such as configuring build pipelines or writing automated tests, to ensure that changes are tested and integrated seamlessly into the codebase.
- Document their work, including keeping track of changes made, maintaining a changelog, and contributing to relevant documentation or knowledge sharing platforms.

By demonstrating their ability to follow these approaches, the apprentice software developer shows that they are capable of working collaboratively, following established practices, and ensuring that the codebase remains organized, manageable, and well-documented.

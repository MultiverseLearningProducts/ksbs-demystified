# S3: link code to data sets

- [ ] Assessment method 2: Professional discussion with Portfolio

Linking code to data sets typically refers to the process of integrating or connecting software code with specific data sets or databases. It involves writing code that can access, retrieve, manipulate, and update data stored in a data set or database. The purpose of linking code to data sets is to enable software applications to interact with and utilize the information stored in the data set.

To demonstrate the ability to link code to data sets, an apprentice software developer may be required to perform tasks such as:

1. **Establishing a Connection**: The developer should write code that establishes a connection between the software application and the data set or database. This typically involves providing the necessary credentials, connection strings, or API keys to access the data.

2. **Querying Data**: The developer should be able to write code that can query the data set or database to retrieve specific information. This may involve using structured query language (SQL) or other query languages supported by the data source.

3. **Manipulating Data**: The developer should demonstrate the ability to manipulate the data retrieved from the data set. This can include tasks such as filtering, sorting, aggregating, or transforming the data according to the requirements of the software application.

4. **Updating Data**: In some cases, the developer may need to write code that can update the data set or database. This could involve adding new records, modifying existing data, or deleting records as needed.

5. **Error Handling**: It's important for the developer to implement error handling mechanisms to deal with potential issues that may arise during data retrieval or manipulation. This can include handling connection failures, handling invalid queries, or managing data integrity.

6. **Integration with Software Application**: Ultimately, the developer should showcase how the linked code interacts with the software application they are working on. This can involve integrating the data retrieved from the data set into the application's user interface or using it for further processing within the application's logic.

By successfully demonstrating the ability to link code to data sets, an apprentice software developer shows their proficiency in working with data and the practical application of their programming skills in retrieving and utilizing information from external sources.
